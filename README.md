# Simple ESP32 Message Receiver
This project demonstrates how to set up a simple message receiver using an ESP32 microcontroller. The receiver listens for messages sent over Wi-Fi and displays them on the serial monitor.
## Requirements
- ESP32 development board
- Micropython firmware installed on the ESP32
- A browser or a tool like Postman to send messages
## How to Use
1. Connect your ESP32 to your computer and upload all the files in this repository.
2. (Optional) Open `main.py` and modify the `ssid` and `password` variables to match your Wi-Fi network credentials.
3. Configure GPIO pins if necessary.
4. Reset the ESP32 to run the code.
5. View the serial monitor to see the tips and messages.
